## Overview

This repository includes two main projects:

1. **Sliding Puzzle**: A Jupyter Notebook that simulates and solves sliding puzzles programmatically using algorithms and visualizations.
2. **Automated Rescue Plan**: A project to create an automated strategy for simulated rescue missions using advanced pathfinding algorithms and AI-driven planning.

Both projects are designed to be educational and practical, providing hands-on experience with solving real-world inspired problems and understanding algorithmic approaches.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, clone the repository to your local machine and ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.

## Project Descriptions

### Sliding Puzzle

The **Sliding Puzzle** notebook explores solving the classic sliding puzzle problem, where tiles on a grid must be rearranged to reach a target configuration. Key highlights of this project include:

- **Puzzle Mechanics**: Explanation of sliding puzzle rules and objectives.
- **Algorithmic Solutions**: Implementation of algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) and heuristic-based methods like A* to solve the puzzle efficiently.
- **Visualization**: Step-by-step visualization of the puzzle states and the solution path, allowing users to see the algorithms in action.
- **Applications**: Insight into how sliding puzzle algorithms relate to broader fields like robotics and game design.

This project is an excellent starting point for understanding search algorithms and optimization techniques.

### Automated Rescue Plan

The **Automated Rescue Plan** notebook focuses on simulating and optimizing a rescue mission scenario, emphasizing strategic planning and efficient resource allocation. Key features include:

- **Scenario Simulation**: Models a rescue mission in a grid-based environment, representing challenges such as terrain, obstacles, and limited resources.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Utilizes algorithms like A* and Dijkstra's to determine the shortest or most efficient paths for rescue operations.
- **AI-Driven Planning**: Incorporates concepts like decision-making under constraints and adaptive strategies to improve rescue outcomes.
- **Visualization**: Provides graphical representations of rescue paths and outcomes, offering an intuitive understanding of the solutions.
- **Real-World Relevance**: Demonstrates how such algorithms can be applied to logistics, emergency planning, and robotics.

This project is ideal for learning advanced algorithms and exploring their applications in critical, real-world scenarios.
